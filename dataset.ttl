Appears on the Moseley map, 1733, as Welch Settlement. Rev. Hugh McAden mentioned the Welsh Tract during his visit to the area in 1755, and the name was still in use in 1775. Persons other than those of Welsh descent soon moved into the area, and the tract lost its identity. About 1740 the Welsh laid out a town that became South Washington, which see." .

Includes approx. 1,110 sq. mi. The surrounding area is approx. 600 ft. above sea level, but, within the Sandhills, there are ridges rising 300 to 400 ft. higher. Little River, Drowning Creek, and Rockfish Creek are the principal streams. Coarse sandy soil is characteristic of the area. The Basset map, 1676, marks the area \"Deserta Arenosa.\" It has also been called Deserta Montana, Sandy Barrens, Pine Barrens, and the Sahara of North Carolina. William Hooper, in a letter of June 15, 1779, to James Iredell, used the term sandhills. The climate of the region has been classed as \"Humid Subtropical,\" and it has an average annual temperature of approx. 61.5°. The area was settled by Scottish Highlanders beginning about 1740. They found the region covered by a stand of longleaf pines ranging in height from 100 to 120 ft. and with diameters up to 36 inches. Beneath the pines, wire grass covered the ground. Most of the pines were cut between 1875 and 1895 (for an exception, see Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve), and the region is now covered with smaller longleaf pines, scrub oak (chiefly Turkey and Black Jack), and wire grass. Extensive peach orchards have flourished in the Sandhills since 1892. The resort towns of Pinehurst and Southern Pines, which see, have developed there." .

In 1816 John Paschall operated a tavern there, and the community was known as Paschalls, the name under which it appears on the MacRae map, 1833. The present name was used when a post office was est. there in 1839; it is said to be derived from the ridge on the N edge of the community on which a railway was built.

It has long been said that the county was named for William III (1650-1702) of the House of Orange, who ruled England from 1689 to 1702. However, in 1752, when the county was formed, the infant William V (1748-1806) of Orange was Stadtholder, and his mother, Anne, daughter of George II of England, controlled affairs of state. It seems reasonable to assume that Orange County was named in honor of William V of Orange (and perhaps also to flatter his grandfather, George II of England) instead of for William III, who had been dead for 50 years. Area: 398 sq. mi. County seat: Hillsborough, with an elevation of 543 ft. Townships are Bingham, Cedar Grove, Chapel Hill, Cheeks, Eno, Hillsborough, and Little River.

Fort Fisher controlled the Cape Fear River and kept the port of Wilmington open. The fort was bombarded from the sea on December 23-25, 1864, and January 12-13, 1865. It fell on January 15.

One of the several Cherokee legends is that the gorge was the haunt of the Uktena (keen-eyed), a huge horned serpent. The bright gem blazing from between its horns was called ulstitlu (it is on his head) and meant death to the family of any Indian who beheld it. However, when detached it became the ulunsuti (transparent), the great talisman that revealed the future to the possessor. When a wary hunter encased himself in leather, surprised the monster, killed it, and tore the great jewel from its head, the snake writhed from one side of the gorge to the other, shutting out the radiance of the sun and causing the perpetual twilight. The great jewel was said to be the rutile quartz, so rare that there was only one specimen among the Eastern Cherokee in 1890. In the gorge, on the left bank of the river, are caves claimed by some to have been occupied by a race that preceded the Cherokee." .
