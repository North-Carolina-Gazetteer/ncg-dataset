It has been said that the county was named for William, Earl of Craven (1606-97), one of the original Lords Proprietors and longest lived of the eight. More likely, however, it was named for his grandnephew, William, Lord Craven (who inherited his title and interest in Carolina and who died the year before the name of the county was changed from Archdale to Craven); or for the third William, Lord Craven, one of the Proprietors at the time the change in the name of the county was made. Area: 785 sq. mi. County seat: New Bern, with an elevation of 12 ft. Townships are nos. 1-3, 5-9; all of former township no. 4 was included in Pamlico County when it was created in 1872.
