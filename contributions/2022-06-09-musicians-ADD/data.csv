His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the traditional way the five-string banjo had previously been played. This new style of playing became popular and elevated the banjo from its previous role as a background rhythm instrument to featured solo status. He popularized the instrument across several genres of music. Scruggs' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in Bill Monroe's band, the Blue Grass Boys. The name ""bluegrass"" eventually became the eponym for the entire genre of country music now known by that title. Despite considerable success with Monroe, performing on the Grand Ole Opry and recording classic hits such as ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"", Scruggs resigned from the group in 1946 due to their exhausting touring schedule. Fellow band member Lester Flatt resigned as well, and he and Scruggs later paired up in a new group they called Flatt and Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys. Scruggs' banjo instrumental called ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown"", released in 1949, became an enduring hit, and had a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. The song won two Grammy Awards and, in 2005, was selected for the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit. Flatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit, ""The Ballad of Jed Clampett"" ?????the theme music for the television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies ?????the first Scruggs recording to reach number one on the Billboard charts. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 singles. The duo broke up in 1969, chiefly because, while Scruggs wanted to switch styles to fit a more modern sound, Flatt was a traditionalist who opposed the change and believed doing so would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists. Although each of them formed a new band to match their visions, neither of them ever regained the success they had achieved as a team. Scruggs received four Grammy awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a National Medal of Arts. He became a member of the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1985, Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the Country Music Hall of Fame and named, as a duo, number 24 on CMT's ""40 Greatest Men of Country Music"". Scruggs was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the United States. Four works by Scruggs have been placed in the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Jody Rainwater was one of thirteen children of M. Wilson and Emma Johnson. He was well known for having played bass with The Foggy Mountain Boys. An elder brother had taken up guitar, and soon they began playing together as ""Chuck and Slim, The Johnson Brothers"". They played at reunions and social gatherings around the area. The brothers found themselves in High Point, North Carolina, auditioning for the new radio station WMFR which began broadcasting in 1936. They were offered a regular time slot every Thursday morning. Their father believed farm work should take priority, so they eventually cancelled their weekly show. The next big thing for The Johnson Brothers occurred at the 1937 Fourth of July Horse Show in Kernersville, North Carolina. There the brothers entered a competition for performers and won the award for ""Best Individual Entertainers"". Rainwater decided to move to Winston-Salem. For four years he found few opportunities in music. He served in the Marines during World War II. In April 1945 he was discharged from active duty and returned to Winston-Salem, where he found work at an auto dealership. While employed there he met a local musician, Woody Hauser. The two formed the band the Blue Ridge Mountain Boys. In 1946 they helped sign on station WTOB and became a regular part of its programming. While playing for WTOB the band played a few local shows in nearby schools. It was during this time that Charles Johnson became ""Little Jody"". Clad in baggy pants, suspenders, and old shirts the character that would soon be made famous with Flat and Scruggs was born. Little Jody and Woody played together for almost three years. After a trip with Woody and several friends to the Grand Ole Opry, Jody determined that he would one day play the Opry. After the trip Jody and Woody were offered the chance to play during the intermission of a Bill Monroe road show in Lexington, North Carolina, which is where Rainwater first met Lester Flatt. In 1948, Jody Rainwater left North Carolina for Roanoke, Virginia where he joined the Blue Star Boys. Later that year he learned that Flatt, Earl Scruggs, and others were leaving the Blue Grass Boys to form the Foggy Mountain Boys. Jody was asked to join them to handle bookings and advertising, but he decided to stay in Roanoke. In 1949 a coal strike devastated the Bristol area's economy and the Foggy Mountain Boys left WCYB for Lexington, Kentucky. WCYB offered the Farm and Fun Time slot to the Blue Star Boys and they took it. This didn't work out well, and at this point Flatt again offered the booking job to Jody, who immediately accepted it. In addition to booking, Jody joined the group on their Saturday night slot on WVLK's Jamboree as Cedric Rainwater's comedic partner. The comedy duo was a hit and Jody was soon being billed as Cedric's younger brother. Lester Flatt suggested the name Little Jody Rainwater and it really stuck. However, the comedic antics of the Rainwater brothers were short lived. Soon Cedric decided to join Hank Williams' Drifting Cowboys and leave bluegrass. The Foggy Mountain Boys found themselves in need of a bassist. For the next three years Rainwater played an important part in the band's sound and stage presence. He was both booking and playing shows. Working seven days a week up to eighteen hours a day. By May 1952 Jody was ""right at a nervous breakdown"", and, at the advice of a physician he put in his notice.

Riddle was born in Burnsville, North Carolina, United States. He grew up with his paternal grandparents near Kingsport, Tennessee, not far from the Virginia border. While working as a young man at a cement plant, in August 1927, he tripped on an auger. The resulting injury entailed the amputation of his right leg at the knee. While he recovered, he took up the guitar, developing an innovative picking and slide technique. Soon, he was collaborating with other musicians from Sullivan and Scott counties, including Steve Tarter, Harry Gay, Brownie McGhee and John Henry Lyons. In December 1928, Riddle met A.P. Carter, who founded the Carter Family country band. The Carter Family had become known for their recordings at the Bristol Sessions in August 1927. Riddle began to divide his time between Kingsport and the Carter home in Maces Spring, Virginia. Riddle and Carter embarked on song-collecting trips around the region: Riddle would act as a ""human tape recorder,"" memorizing the melody while Carter gathered lyrics. The Carter Family went on to record a number of songs that Riddle either composed or transmitted, including ""Cannonball Blues,"" ""Hello Stranger,"" ""I Know What It Means To Be Lonesome,"" ""Let the Church Roll On,"" ""Bear Creek Blues,"" ""March Winds Goin' Blow My Blues Away"" and ""Lonesome For You."" Riddle's guitar technique made an impression on Maybelle Carter, and she incorporated elements of it into her style. In 1937, Riddle got married and, in 1942, moved to Rochester, New York. Soon he retired from music, and in 1945, he sold his guitar, remaining obscure for the next twenty years. In 1965, Mike Seeger, fresh from a collaboration with Maybelle Carter, tracked down Riddle and persuaded him to return to recording music. Over the next 13 years, Riddle and Seeger made a series of studio recordings, several of them compiled in the album ""Step by Step"", released in 1993. Riddle also made appearances at the Smithsonian Folk Festival and the Mariposa Folk Festival. Riddle died in July 1980, in Asheville, North Carolina. In 1993, a selection from the sessions with Mike Seeger was released by Rounder Records as Step By Step: Lesley Riddle Meets The Carter Family: Blues, Country & Sacred Songs. On July 31, 2009, a stage production about Riddle's life, including his time with and influence on the Carter Family, had its world premier at the Parkway Playhouse in Burnsville, North Carolina, Riddle's birthplace. The show featured biographical details of his life, plus versions of songs as he played them, and then again as the Carters played them. The production was called Esley: The Life and Music of Lesley Riddle, written by Jeff Douglas Messer, directed by Michael Lilly, and starring Jim Arrendell as Esley. In mid-2015, Parkway Playhouse revived the stage production of Esley with a new cast of actors, but still under the direction of Michael Lilly. Playwright Jeff Douglas Messer is currently working on a screenplay and novel based on the stage script.

The band's instrumental canvas proved to be larger and more eclectic than that of the typical indie group, buoying the usual guitars and rhythm section with violin, organ, and creative non-rap samples. Faced with the challenge of labeling such music, the Comas' label billed deemed the sound ""stoner pop.""

Wolfe was born in Raleigh, NC, and moved to Texas when she was 8 years old. She started playing guitar at the age of 5 and also started to play drums at an early age. In her college years at St. Edward's University she began to perform live. Wolfe released her first album, Director's Notes on February 28, 2012. Her debut EP, Mechanical Hands, released on May 23, 2013, was produced by Mike McCarthy. Wolfe performed vocals and guitar, with Hannah Hagar on keys and vocals, Sam Pankey on bass, and Jeffrey Olson on drums. Her second EP, Roulette, self-released in 2014, was produced by Mike McCarthy. That same year she toured with Allen Stone, performed at Austin City Limits, BottleRock Napa, and South by Southwest, and toured the west coast. In 2016, Wolfe was featured in Uproxx's ""Uncharted Series"" and returned for live dates on the west coast, as well as toured and performed with Gary Clark Jr., The Toadies, Heart, The Pretenders, and performed at Sound on Sound Fest in Texas. In 2017, she began production for her second full-length album, with Alabama Shakes keyboardist Ben Tanner (St. Paul & The Broken Bones, Dylan LeBlanc) producing. The album was recorded at Portside Sound in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and Arlyn Studios in Austin, TX, and features Evan Nicholson on bass and Clellan Hyatt on drums. In attempting to bring to life Wolfe's dream of mixing Demi Lovato and Queens of the Stone Age, she has said, ""I wanted to explore weird combinations that seem bizarre. I noticed that in pop music, whenever the chorus hits, they put this airy synth in the back of every single pop hit - I’m like, Okay, we’ve got to figure out how to make that happen. That seems to lift the chorus out of the song, making it a monster on its own. I also had a massive folder of just samples – I asked Ben to pick the coolest ones to see if we could use them on the record."" Of striving to incorporate this idea with Wolfe's live-show energy, Tanner has said, ""The way pop music works - when the chorus hits or the solo hits - things get really tall, and changes in the high end and low end make it feel huge. It’s more produced than just these three people playing together in a room, but you don’t want it to be so overly produced or overly polished that it loses the flow of who Emily is an artist. A lot of it’s in the moment - if we can make it elicit an emotional response in ourselves, then hopefully it will in somebody else, too."" That self-titled, self-released album was released February 15, 2019. A co-billed tour with Black Pistol Fire followed through the east coast and midwest, followed by multiple headline dates through the east coast, midwest, and west coast, including 3rd & Lindsley in Nashville, WTMD’s First Thursday concert series in Baltimore, Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn, Lincoln Calling Festival in Nebraska, The Mint in Los Angeles, The Independent in San Francisco, and the Empty Bottle in Chicago. In May 2019, the single “Holy Roller” was serviced to AAA radio, with support from 20+ stations, and remained on that format's charts for four-plus months. An extensive radio promotional tour included visits to stations in Nashville, Baltimore, Albany, Woodstock, Pittsburgh, and Columbus, Ohio. In June 2021, Wolfe released her third album, Outlier, on Crows Feet Records. The album was produced by Michael Shuman of Queens of the Stone Age, who also received performance and co-writing credits on the record.

When he was thirteen years old, Common found his older brother's Epiphone acoustic guitar in a closet and began writing songs. While in Pensacola, Common founded and fronted the psychedelic roots rock band Bunkhouse Jones. Featuring drummer Matthew Baranowski, guitarists Aaron Monte and Richard Abercrombie, Bunkhouse Jones released two records and toured clubs and small venues in the South. After finishing school, he traveled around the country to New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Burlington, and other towns writing, busking, playing shows and making lo-fi recordings. After a stint working on a small family farm in Denmark, Kansas, he made his way to Colorado. As the singer, songwriter and guitarist for the Denver-based roots rock/alt-country band Rainville, he built a reputation for writing gritty, honest songs. Rainville released two albums to critical acclaim nationally and in Europe, and toured from 1999 to 2004. Common began exploring different musical and lyrical territory in 2005. This new creative direction surfaced on Good To Be Born and Why Birds Fly – the first two records released under his name on Free School Records in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Those two records established Common in the Denver music scene as an independent artist and songwriter. He continued to evolve his sound by releasing a record entitled Beautiful Empty under the name John Common and Blinding Flashes of Light in 2011. That full length was quickly followed by an EP named Side 3. Common's band, Blinding Flashes of Light, was a large collective of musicians, artists and friends drawn from Denver's indie music scene.

Monk is the second-most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington. Monk's compositions and improvisations feature dissonances and angular melodic twists and are consistent with his unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of switched key releases, silences, and hesitations. Monk was renowned for a distinct look which included suits, hats, and sunglasses. He was also noted for an idiosyncratic habit during performances: while other musicians continued playing, Monk would stop, stand up, and dance for a few moments before returning to the piano. Monk is one of five jazz musicians to have been featured on the cover of Time magazine (the others being Louis Armstrong, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington and Wynton Marsalis)."

Based in Seattle, Washington since 1985, Shoup is a mainstay of that city's improvised music scene. Seattle Metropolitan named him one of the 50 most influential musicians in that city's history. Born in North Carolina, and raised in Charlotte, Initially working as a schoolteacher, Shoup moved Atlanta, Georgia in the late 1960s, then to Colorado in 1970. There, he first lived in Manitou Springs and later in Colorado Springs. By his own account, Shoup ""grew up listening to black music in the South, the blues and jazz and R&B,"" was ""introduced to free jazz in the late '60s… in Atlanta"". Although his ""voice is definitely influenced by African-American music"" he ""kind of felt like free jazz was the domain of black musicians."" Hearing Britain's , ""he simultaneously discovered free improvisation and his calling as a musician."" ""It wasn't jazz-based,"" he would say in 2003."" They were trying to find some new ways of improvising. I realized that was the kind of music I wanted to know about, and the only way I could know more about it was by playing it."" While in Colorado, Shoup had a three-hour weekly show on KRCC, the Colorado College radio station, where by Jason Heller's account (2003) he played jazz and experimental music from his own extensive collection, and ""began using the studio itself as an instrument, manipulating multiple turntables and mixing in guest musicians who would improvise over the records…"" Describing a band he organized during this period, the Creative Music Ensemble (active circa 1973–74), Shoup later said, ""I was still developing some chops on the sax, so I wasn't a player yet; I was just the instigator. I had them play a number of gigs, and it just outraged and pissed people off. … People didn't know what to make of it. It was kind of like Mahavishnu meets Merzbow or something."" In 1975 he became an active organizer, deejay, and player of music merging free jazz, free improvisation and noise. After deciding he was ready to play the saxophone as a performer, he formed his first trio, in Colorado, with Ross Rabin and Keith Gardner, incorporating contact microphones on metal objects to create ""noisescapes."" He released his first album, Scree-Run Waltz in 1981. In 1983 he moved to Birmingham, Alabama where he performed with (Davey Williams and LaDonna Smith), wrote for the Improvisor magazine and worked with dancer , with whom he toured European in 1985, after which he moved to Seattle.

Among the groups he performed with there were the New Art Orchestra and Catabatics. In 2010 he will participate in and help organize the 25th anniversary Seattle Improvised Music Festival. In 1994 he and cellist Brent Arnold formed Project W, who would eventually open for Sonic Youth in Seattle in 1998. Writing in 1999, Andrew Bartlett described this as ""Shoup's most vaunted ensemble… whose debut CD of the same name on the Apraxia label has become the stuff of legend."" Bartlett singled out their emphasis on relatively short pieces as unusual for free improvisors. Shoup has done two CDs with Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth Hurricane Floyd (Subliminal, 2000) and Live at Tonic (Leo Records, 2003) with Paul Flaherty and Chris Corsano. He has also made two recordings with Nels Cline of Wilco: Immolation/Immersion (CD, 2005) and Suite: Bittersweet (LP, 2007), both on Strange Attractors Audio House. Shoup formed the Wally Shoup Trio in 2001 with bassist Reuben Radding and drummer Bob Rees. Speaking of his work in 2003, Shoup said, ""I'm not quite as abstract as I used to be. On my new stuff, I'll play motifs and melodies and occasionally even a tune … I see noise as just another element to play with, just another texture or color or detail."" More recent projects include Spider Trio (with Jeffery Taylor and Dave Abramson) and the Wally Shoup Quartet (with Gust Burns, Bob Rees and Paul Kikuchi). Among the festivals where Shoup has performed are the Vancouver Jazz Festival (Vancouver, B.C.), Earshot Jazz Festival (Seattle), (Scotland), (Birmingham, Alabama), Seattle Improvised Music Festival and (Belgium).

By 1952, the company had folded and she recorded the first of six singles for Derby Records in New York City. Her first recording for the label was ""I May Hate Myself In The Morning"", written by Bennie Benjamin and George Weiss, and recorded with the Orchestra. The song rapidly became a hit, reaching no.23 on the national pop chart, a remarkable achievement at the time for an ""R&B-tinged"" record on an independent label. She toured in the US and Canada with The Ink Spots, and her follow-up record, ""My Heart Belongs to Only You"", with vocal group the Striders, was also a success. By the end of 1952 she signed with the Coral label, a subsidiary of Decca Records, and appeared at the Apollo Theater. The following year she had her second chart hit, ""Only A Rose"", backed by the Sy Oliver Orchestra; the record reached no.25 on the Billboard pop chart.

Early in 1954 she appeared with Dizzy Gillespie, Dusty Fletcher and George Kirby in Philadelphia, and toured with vocal group the Dew Droppers. She left Coral, and Derby issued some unreleased tracks by her on their subsidiary Central label, but she did not record again until later in the year when she joined the Jubilee label, who marketed her as a pop rather than R&B performer. However, her recordings were unsuccessful and she recorded for her manager Phil Rose's Glory label, backed by vocal group the Four Fellows, featuring Larry Banks. Although changing musical tastes meant that she was increasingly relegated to occasional performances, she recorded ""What A Night For Love"" for Atco in 1957, and ""Zip"" for Capitol in early 1960, before retiring from the music business due to diabetes.

Wilson is the son of Charlotte poet Dede Wilson and was living in the Blue House, a Raleigh crash pad and romper room for the area's hottest young musicians. The other members are banjo picker Chandler Holt, upright bassist Greg Readling, and multi-instrumentalist John Teer. Wilson and Readling were playing in the Blue House as ""Stillhouse"" when Teer and Holt became intrigued ""to hear these guys playing original country music that didn't suck"" as Holt recalls. Holt and Teer befriended Wilson at the Blue House and began sitting in with the band. Wilson, over a beer one night, asked the others if they were interested in starting a bluegrass band. Chatham County Line began as an opening act for , Tift Merritt's band. Chris Stamey saw them open a show, offered to record them, and landed them a record deal with Yep Roc Records.

The band consists of Cheetie Kumar (guitar), David Mueller (bass), Scott Nurkin (drums), Paul Siler (guitar), Jason Alyward (drums) and Missy Thangs (keys). The band was formed after guitarists Paul Siler and Cheetie Kumar split from The Cherry Valence to join forces with vocalist, Craig Tilley, and bassist, David Mueller. They soon enlisted Chapel Hill drummer/artist Scott Nurkin and quickly made a name for themselves after their ’07 Volcom debut Bazaar Bazaar, ’08′s follow-up EP Outer Upper Inner. Relentless touring in support of these releases with the likes of The Racontuers, The Flaming Lips, Black Mountain, The Fucking Champs, Mudhoney, Monotonix, and Ted Leo, made BIRDS OF AVALON road vets—a band’s band with one of the best live rock shows going. The band then retreated to their home and began an extensive period of writing and recording, using their rehearsal space at Kumar and Siler's house as a makeshift studio. Recordings done at the home resulted in band's second full-length album, Uncanny Valley, released in summer 2009 on Volcom Entertainment. The album was quickly recorded on an old 3M 16-track tape machine borrowed from Mitch Easter who, with Cheetie Kumar, mixed the record at Fidelitorium. The name Uncanny Valley comes from a theory which was introduced by Japanese roboticist, Masahiro Mori, in 1970 to describe the phenomena by which human beings become more unsettled by robots or other human facsimiles in direct proportion to how lifelike they appear. Uncanny Valley was their final album for Volcom. It was recorded after actually completing another complete album just a couple of months previously. The band decided against releasing that one on Volcom feeling that the more spontaneous Uncanny Valley was a better match for the label. Much of 2010 was a transitional time for the group. Paul and Cheetie, along with co-owners Steve Popson (Polvo) and Ben Barwick (Ashley Stove), re-opened live venue Kings Barcade. Siler also kept busy booking Raleigh’s inaugural and highly successful Hopscotch Music Festival. All this on the heels of the amicable departure of vocalist Craig Tilley afforded the band an opportunity to re-evaluate and evolve their sound with a focus on group harmonies and a freer approach to writing and performing. In January 2011, the band released their third full length on Bladen County Records. The self-titled album, another analog-only collaboration with Mitch Easter (REM, Wilco, Pavement), draws on the pop-aesthetic of Bazaar Bazaar but blazes new progressive trails while anticipating the psychedelic experimentation of Uncanny Valley. Gigantic Music released the vinyl of the S/T LP in the Summer of 2011. In 2015 Birds Of Avalon joined forces with Missy Thangs (The Love Language) and Jason Alyward (Valient Thorr) to include synth and a second drummer.
