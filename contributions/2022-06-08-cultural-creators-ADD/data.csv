Ervin T. Rouse,C-78,NCG18049,Q111463610,Q5396069,"“Orange Blossom Special,” written in 1938 by Craven County native Ervin T. Rouse, has been called the “unofficial anthem of bluegrass.”  Recorded first by Chubby Wise, it was brought to wide attention in 1942 by Bill Monroe and returned to the charts in 1965 by Johnny Cash.  Born in 1917 east of Fort Barnwell, Rouse is said by some to have been the “greatest fiddle player to ever put rosin to a bow.” He left home at the age of eight to play in vaudeville shows in New York.  For a time he and his brother followed an evangelist and used their musical skills to energize audiences.  While on the road from a tender age, Rouse considered North Carolina home until 1938 when he bought a house in Miami.

	It was in Florida that Rouse became acquainted with the Orange Blossom Special, a passenger train operated from New York to Miami by the Seaboard Air Line Railway from 1925 to the early 1960s.  The song, with its vocals and interplay of fiddle and harmonica, evoked the train’s sound and speed.  Biographer Randy Noles settled any questions about the song’s authorship which others had assigned jointly to Rouse and Wise.  Rouse’s other compositions, among them “(I’ve got those) Craven County Blues,” did not reach as wide an audience.  

	Rouse married Hattie Whitehurst in 1941; they had three children.  She left him in 1954 and moved back to North Carolina.  Rouse visited his native state about twice a year in the 1950s and 1960s, often playing shows in New Bern, Kinston, and Cove City.  When Johnny Cash revived the song, Rouse took the stage to share the acclaim in one show.  Cash supported him directly and through royalties.  In his last years (he died in 1981) Rouse was troubled by alcoholism and mental illness, fiddling for tips in isolated taverns on the edge of the Everglades.  But the song endures and has been featured in the film “Urban Cowboy” and the TV series “Benny Hill.”  In 2005 the <I>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</I> named “Orange Blossom Special” one of 100 “Songs of the South.”

Millie McKoy,D-74,NCG18134,Q111462929,Q40324815,"It is an accident of nature that two sets of Siamese twins called North Carolina home in the 19th century, the better known being [Eng and Chang Bunker, M-7] who settled in Surry County.  Native-born conjoined twins, Millie-Christine McKoy, were born into slavery in 1851 on the plantation of Jabez McKoy near Whiteville.  The young twins were sold several times before their first successful promoter purchased them in Boston when they were four.  Their last legal owner was Joseph Smith even though they were abducted from his care twice by men who sought to exploit them.  Smith toured with the girls throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe before the start of the Civil War.  During the war, Smith hid the twins near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to prevent their capture.  Freed after the war, Millie-Christine again traveled and performed in practically every state, and were seen by European royalty.  Queen Victoria of England enjoyed their performances and presented them with jewelry.  Many of their appearances were with [P.T. Barnum’s, E-61] circus troupe.

	Physicians took great interest in their physiology and, after much study, it was determined that they shared portions of their pelvis and spinal cord, making separation impossible.  The twins were intelligent and although they were two separate personalities, they referred to themselves in the singular.  Exceptionally talented singers, Millie-Christine was often billed as the “Carolina Nightingale.” As result of their star status, the twins were prosperous and were able to purchase the original property on which they were born and built a ten-room house where they lived between tours.  Their hectic tours stopped around 1900 and they retired to their home which burned in 1909.  

	Millie suffered with tuberculosis  and in 1912 she died on October 8th.  Christine could not safely be separated from her sister and died the next day after being heavily sedated by doctors.  Fearful of being dissected post-mortem, Millie-Christine wanted to be cremated but arrangements were made for them to be buried in a specially made coffin near their home.  The burial was guarded for almost a year after their death to prevent grave-robbing.  Their grave marker was made of two lead sheets shaped into two arches joined by a bridge inscribed “A soul with two thoughts.  Two hearts that beat as one.”  Over the years the cemetery became overgrown and the Columbus County Historical Society removed their remains to Welches Creek Community Cemetery.

Thelonious Monk,E-119,NCG18300,Q111464005,Q109612,"Thelonious Monk lived most of his life in Manhattan but his North Carolina roots ran deep.  His ancestors lived in Sampson County, near Bentonville Battleground.  His father (also Thelonious), moved to Rocky Mount, to the ""Around the Y"" community alongside the Atlantic Coastline Railroad where he worked.  There he married  in 1914 Barbara Batts, who grew up in Edgecombe County.  She and her children left for New York when young Monk was four and settled near San Juan Hill.  Monk attended but did not graduate from Stuyvesant High School.

	The third composition he copyrighted (first as sole composer) was also his best-known, “’Round Midnight.”  According to the website www.jazzstandards.com, it is the most recorded jazz standard of all time.  Monk’s style was original and unorthodox, incorporating elements of stride piano and gospel to create a “rhythmic virtuosity,” striking dissonant notes and playing skewed melodies.  He collaborated with Dizzy Gillespie (widely credited like Monk with being an architect of bebop), Charlie Parker, and [John Coltrane, K-31].  A drug conviction in 1951 (he took the fall for the drugs in the car belonging to Bud Powell) led to loss of his cabaret card for seven years, a period when his acclaimed recordings fixed his reputation in the jazz pantheon.

	Personally, Monk had a reputation as the ultimate hipster, with his goatee, skullcap, and bamboo-rimmed sunglasses.  He was a large man, given to leaving the keyboard to dance while onstage and, at random moments, on the street or in public spaces, twirling for several minutes.  Viewed by some as temperamental, eccentric, and even childlike, he is described by his biographer Robin Kelley as essentially rebellious.  Kelley documented that Monk suffered from bipolar disorder most of his adult life.  

	In 1972 Monk withdrew from public appearances and was hospitalized intermittently until his death.  Among his last extended stands was a week at the Frog and Nightgown in Raleigh’s Cameron Village in 1970.  A park in his hometown has carried his name since 2000.

Kay Kyser,E-124,NCG18304,Q111464010,Q1284551,"James Kern “Kay” Kyser was a popular big band leader of the 1930s and 1940s.  Born in Rocky Mount on June 18, 1905, he attended the [University of North Carolina, G-92] where he first studied law before switching to commerce.  He graduated with a degree in the latter field and was senior class president.  While at Chapel Hill, he was a cheerleader and a member of the PlayMakers Repertory Company.  He later wrote the song “Tar Heels on Hand,” which became a school fight song.

Kyser was not a singer or musician and came into his role as a bandleader almost by accident, when he was asked to succeed Hal Kemp as leader of a local band made up of UNC students.  What Kyser lacked in musical talent he made up for by his talents as a performer, functioning as a wacky announcer.  The band continued to tour after its members graduated.  Their success was gradual but began to attract a following after it became the house band for the Blackhawk Restaurant in Chicago.  In 1935, the group achieved its first Top 40 hit.  Over the next several years they produced 10 more, and landed a total of 35 hits within the Top 10.   Many of the band’s tunes were whimsical, and in fact their last major hit was the theme music for the “Woody Woodpecker” cartoon series.  

Kyser’s band gained their own radio show in 1938, the “Kollege of Musical Knowledge,” where Kyser adopted the persona of a quiz show musical expert called the “Ol’ Perfesser.”  Kyser involved various members of the band in his antics, especially trumpeter Melvin Bogue, nicknamed “Ish Kabibble,” who portrayed a dumb student of the “Kollege.”  The radio show in turn led to a series of motion picture comedies built around Kyser and his band.  By the mid-1940s, Kyser had become one of the most popular and best-paid of the big band leaders, despite his unorthodox style.  Featured on radio 1938 to 1948, the show moved to television, 1949-1950.

Following a fire which destroyed many of the group’s collection of musical arrangements, the band adopted a jazzier approach to its sound.  During World War II, Kyser frequently entertained U.S. servicemen as part of the USO program.  During this time he met his future wife, Georgia Carroll, after she became a vocalist in the group.  The 1940s incarnation of the band also launched the career of singer Mike Douglas, who later became a popular television talk show host.

Kyser became increasingly disenchanted with the trappings of show business as time went on. Ongoing health concerns played a role in this, but Kyser also genuinely felt during the war that what he did paled before the sacrifices of those who worked in the service of others.  He thus began to seek a way out, even though contracts kept him from walking away from his career for several years.  When the television version of the “Kollege” was cancelled in 1950, he finally and quietly quit.  

He retired with his family to Chapel Hill, where he and his wife devoted their efforts to charity work.  The Kysers supported the university, especially the drama department, and played a role in bringing public television to the state.  Kyser supported the Good Health Program, created by the state during World War II to foster health and fitness awareness and finance hospitals and medical education.  Kyser also was a promoter of the Christian Science movement, having become a convert in the 1940s while seeking treatment for problems with his feet. He died in Chapel Hill on July 24, 1985.

Edwin Wiley Fuller,E-77,NCG18258,Q111463876,Q108575130,"A native of Louisburg, Edwin Wiley Fuller is best remembered for his novel <i>Sea-Gift</i>, in which he depicted student life at his alma mater, the [University of North Carolina, G-92].  His Chapel Hill years commenced in 1864 but were interrupted by his father’s illness, which required his return home.  Fuller completed his education at the University of Virginia, earning a degree in 1868.  At Chapel Hill and in Charlottesville he published poetry.  Back in Louisburg, he took over his father’s store and pursued his literary interests as a sideline.

	Fuller’s first novel, <i>Angel in the Cloud</i>, appeared in 1871 and went through five editions by 1907.  His novel <i>Sea-Gift</i>, which according to family tradition was written when he was eighteen, was published by E. J. Hale & Son in 1873.  His works were widely read in his day.  <i>Sea-Gift</i> is 348 pages long and takes its title from an incident described whereby a shipwreck off the North Carolina coast deposited the book’s heroine upon the beach.  The “sea-gift” marries the other principal character, a former student at the University.  Tales of romance and adventure ensue.  The book in time was so popular among students at UNC that it was known at the “Freshman’s Bible.”  In 1871 Fuller married Mary Elisabeth Malone and they had two daughters.  He died at the age of twenty-eight.

Billy Strayhorn,G-125,NCG18507,Q111464200,Q380626,"William Thomas (“Billy” professionally) Strayhorn, Duke Ellington’s longtime collaborator, was among the most influential figures in American jazz.  A versatile composer, arranger, and pianist, Strayhorn joined Ellington’s orchestra at age 22 in 1939 and worked with the bandleader the rest of his life.  Ellington publicly acknowledged the central role Strayhorn played in his success, writing the band’s theme “Take the A Train” and penning popular and widely recorded songs such as “Lush Life” and “Satin Doll.”  Strayhorn was a formative influence on an entire generation of musicians.  Living in New York City most of his adult life, he was actively involved in the civil rights movement and was a personal friend of [Martin Luther King Jr., E-112]. 

	Although Strayhorn was born in Dayton, Ohio, his roots ran deep in Orange County and, importantly, his frequent stays in Hillsborough as a boy were essential to his musical development.  His father and grandfather both worked at the Eno Mill.  His grandparents, who owned a piano, lived in a house (now gone) at the corner of Margaret Lane and Hillsborough Avenue.  Returning with his mother and siblings to North Carolina from Ohio regularly from age five, Strayhorn attended his first year of school while in Hillsborough; a classmate remembered him as “small and bright.”  He spent breaks and summers in North Carolina through his early teenage years (by then the family had moved to Pittsburgh) and often took the train to visit an uncle in Durham.  

Biographer David Hajdu contends that North Carolina became the young man’s spiritual home, the place he was introduced to music.  Initially gospel tunes drew him to the piano.  He often wandered through the slave cemetery across from his boyhood home and walked along the Eno River.  At Strayhorn’s death at age 52 in 1967, Ellington said his friend “had no aspirations to enter into any kind of competition, yet the legacy he leaves, his oeuvre, will never be less than the ultimate on the highest plateau of culture.”  In 2007 Strayhorn was the subject of a PBS documentary.

Elizabeth Cotten,G-129,NCG18511,Q111464205,Q454320,"Elizabeth Nevills Cotten taught the world “Freight Train,” “Shake Sugaree,” and a host of other songs.  Her “parlor ragtime” style was no less elegant for the guitar being turned upside down and the thumb and finger roles being reversed.  

The 1900 census indicates that she was born in 1893 and originally called Ella by her family.  The Nevills lived just west of Chapel Hill, an area that would eventually be incorporated as Carrboro. She was born and grew up near the railroad tracks on what is now called Lloyd Street. She wrote “Freight Train” at age 11.  
Her early biography reads much like those of most of the people around her:  hard work punctuated by frolics, music, marriage, church and family.  Her early married life entailed moving among North Carolina, New York, and Washington, D.C., caring for her mechanic husband Frank and her daughter Lillie. Once Lillie was married, she and Frank divorced and she took up life in Washington with her daughter. 

 Joining the church had necessitated all but giving up music.  Mostly she did domestic work, but clerking at a department store fortuitously led to her employment by composer and folklorist Ruth Crawford Seeger.  It was while working for Seeger's family that she idly picked up a guitar and revealed herself to be precisely the kind of native player they held up as an ideal.  By then she was over sixty years old.

Seeger’s son Mike made a project of recording her songs, releasing a Folkways record of them just in time for it to receive great acclaim as a supporting document for the folk revival of the early sixties.  Thousands of middle class youngsters learned “Freight Train” as their first foray into finger picking, and from there went on to study the deeper traditional music millions of Appalachian and African American musicians played largely for their own amusement.  

Libba Cotten ceased domestic work and spent the rest of her life as a traveling entertainer.  She performed at the 1963 Philadelphia Folk Festival and the 1964 Newport Folk Festival.  She would be honored as a National Heritage Fellow and won a Grammy at the age of ninety-one in 1984.  

Despite being played left handed and upside down, her music became popular because it was simple for beginning players to execute, and because it was exemplary of  fundamental Southern musical ideas that ramified into blues, country, ragtime, early jazz, and swing.  She died on June 29, 1987, and is buried in Syracuse, New York.

Pauli Murray,G-48,NCG18430,Q111463010,Q7154879,"Anna Pauline (Pauli) Murray, lawyer, professor, writer, outspoken civil and gender rights activist, and Episcopal priest, was born in Baltimore.  When she was three years old, her mother died and, as her father was confined to a state hospital, she went to live with her aunt, and namesake, Pauline Fitzgerald Dame of Durham.  She graduated at sixteen from segregated Hillside High School as valedictorian. 
 
 Murray enrolled at Richmond Hill High School in New York, the only black student, to complete high school.  Determined to attend an integrated college, but unable to meet stringent requirements, academic and financial, at Barnard, she matriculated at Hunter College.  She worked briefly at Camp Tera, a New Deal work project, there meeting Eleanor Roosevelt, who would be a guiding force in her life.  

 In 1938 she applied to the University of North Carolina to study sociology.  Her application, against state law which required “separate but equal” institutions, garnered national attention.  Her unsuccessful campaign for admission was the first time that she experienced what she would later summarize in saying that one woman with a typewriter constitutes a movement.  

 Despite having served jail time for refusing to sit at the back of a bus in Virginia, Murray was admitted to Howard Law School in 1941 where she experienced discrimination due to her gender rather than her race.  When awarded a fellowship to pursue advanced legal education, she was rejected by Harvard, again, because of her gender.  She went to California to study for a master’s in law.  Later she would wonder which was the bigger obstacle to her legal career, race or gender.

 Murray published <i>State’s Laws on Race and Color</i> in 1951.  Thurgood Marshall called the work “the Bible for civil rights lawyers.”  Her second book, a biographical account, was <i>Proud Shoes: The Story of an American Family</i> (1956).  In 1960 she travelled to Ghana to teach law at the University of Ghana and later authored the first English-language textbook on law in Africa. 

 Murray worked for civil rights and women’s organizations, helped found the National Organization of Women (NOW), and was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to the Committee on Civil and Political Rights within his Commission on the Status of Women.  She remained critical of the lack of leadership roles for women in many of the organizations.  She published a volume of poetry, <i>Dark Testament</i>, in 1970.  

 In 1977 Murray became the first African American female Episcopal priest in the United States, and held her first Eucharist at the Chapel of the Cross in Chapel Hill, where her grandmother had been baptized as a slave.  About the special day she wrote, ""All the strands of my life had come together.""  Pauli Murray died on July 1, 1985, in Pittsburgh.  She is buried in Cypress Hill Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.  Her autobiography, <i>Song in a Weary Throat: An American Pilgrimage</i>, was published in 1987.

Henry Jerome Stockard,G-58,NCG18440,Q111463020,Q109856398,"Henry Jerome Stockard, educator and poet, was born in Chatham County on September 15, 1858, the ninth of James G. and Mary J. Stockard’s ten sons.  In 1870, James died, leaving his wife raising all the children.  Henry, twelve at the time, went to work as a laborer to help support the family; however, his mother insisted that he receive a proper education.

Stockard attended Graham High School and took courses under Professor Thomas Hume at the [University of North Carolina, G-92] before entering [Elon College, G-52]. After graduation from Elon in 1889, Stockard taught high school in Alamance County, became principal of Graham High, and then superintendent of Alamance County schools. Stockard married Sallie Holleman in 1878.  Before her death ten years later, the couple had four children.  In May 1890, soon after his Elon graduation, Stockard wed Margaret Lula Tate of Graham, with whom he had six more children.   In 1892 he returned for a one-year appointment teaching English at the University of North Carolina.

An appointment as a professor of English and political science took Stockard to Fredericksburg College in Virginia in 1893, where he remained for seven years.  In 1900, Stockard returned to North Carolina as a Latin professor at [Peace Institute, H-9] in Raleigh; he then served as president of Peace until 1912.  Preferring the classroom to the boardroom, Stockard chose to return to his professorship, which he continued until his death in 1914.  That year, [Wake Forest College, H-75] awarded him an honorary Litt. D. degree.  

Stockard left a strong literary legacy.  His poetry appeared in <i>Harper’s</i>, <i>Scribner’s</i>, <i>Century</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and the <i>Library of Southern Literature</i>, and he became recognized as the unofficial poet laureate of North Carolina.  He published two volumes of poetry, <i>Fugitive Lines</i> (1897) and <i>A Study of Poetry</i> (1911).  Stockard also composed poems for ceremonies, such as the unveilings of the North Carolina monument at Appomattox, Virginia, and the monument to the women of the Confederacy on Capitol Square in Raleigh.  He also helped found the North Carolina Literary and Historical Association. 

Stockard died on September 5, 1914, ten days shy of his fifty-sixth birthday.  He is buried in [Oakwood Cemetery, H-67] in Raleigh.  A portrait of him hangs in the administration building at Peace College.

George Moses Horton,H-108,NCG18631,Q111463951,Q5542654,"The place of George Moses Horton in American letters is well-established.  Among the most important black poets in the antebellum era, Horton was the first African American to publish a book in the South.  Interest in his work has increased in recent years.  Horton was among the fifteen inaugural inductees into the North Carolina Literary Hall of Fame in 1996.  The following year the George Moses Horton Society for the Study of African American Poetry was founded at the [University of North Carolina, G-92].  His life story, and how he became a published poet while in bondage and unable to write, fascinates to this day.  

       	Horton was an infant when owner William Horton moved from Northampton County to Chatham County.  In 1814 the elder Horton gave George to his son James.  By all accounts, and given the fact that he could travel about, George endured a relatively mild bondage.  He surreptitiously taught himself to read.  He walked on weekends to Chapel Hill where he sold fruit and was prodded into reciting poems for UNC students.  Many purchased acrostics for objects of their affection.  Some accounts portray him as a subject of their ridicule.  Still, he made friends, among them UNC President Joseph Caldwell.  Caroline Hentz, a faculty wife, assisted him in transcribing his poems and in 1829 Raleigh printer [Joseph Gales, H-99] published his book, <i>The Hope of Liberty</i>.  The “sable orator,” as he signed his works, by 1832 had taught himself to write.  Without success he sought help in gaining his freedom.  Volumes of his work also appeared in 1845 and 1865 (<i>Naked Genius</i>).  In 1866 he moved to Philadelphia, after which little is known of his life.  In 1883, the last year of his life, a visitor found him pleased to be called “Poet.”
   
       	Owner James Horton died in 1843 and his son Hall inherited the slave poet.  Hall Horton’s homestead, according to a plat drawn for his widow Adeline in 1867, stood opposite the “Meeting House lot,” the present site of Mount Gilead Church, four miles north of the Haw River and two miles southeast of US 15/501.  Approved in 1999, the placement of the marker was delayed until 2006 awaiting the completion of the highway improvement project in the area.

Ava Gardner,H-122,NCG18644,Q111463966,Q164487,"Born on December 24, 1922, Ava Lavinia Gardner spent most of her childhood in the rural Johnston County community of Grabtown.  In 1935, the Gardner family moved to Newport News, [Virginia, M-14], where her parents secured work at a boarding house. Following her father’s death in 1938, Gardner and her family returned to North Carolina, settling in the Rock Ridge community in Wilson County.  Gardner graduated from Rock Ridge High School the following year and attended secretarial school at Atlantic Christian College (now [Barton College, F-30]).

Her big break came after MGM received portraits of Gardner from her brother-in-law, a professional photographer in New York City.  Following a screen test, the studio signed her to a seven year movie deal for $50 a week, prompting Gardner to relocate to Hollywood at age nineteen.  She had a number of small roles or obscure performances preceding the debut of the critically acclaimed film <i>The Killers</i> in 1946, in which she portrayed femme fatale Kitty Collins.  A string of box office hits followed, including most notably <i>One Touch of Venus</i> (1948), <i>Pandora and the Flying Dutchman</i> (1951), [<i>Show Boat</i>, B-56] (1951), <i>The Snows of Kilimanjaro</i> (1952), <i>The Barefoot Contessa</i> (1954), <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> (1957), and <i>The Night of the Iguana</i> (1964). 

In March 1954, Gardner attended the 26th Academy Awards, having been nominated for Best Actress for her role as Eloise “Honey Bear” Kelly in <i>Mogambo</i> (1953).  Her co-star, Grace Kelly, was also nominated, in the best supporting actress category.  Kelly walked away with an Oscar, but Gardner lost out to newcomer Audrey Hepburn, who took the award for her performance in <i>Roman Holiday</i>.  The nomination in 1954 proved to be Gardner’s only shot at an Academy Award.

In total, Gardner appeared in sixty-seven films. During her lifetime, she had high profile relationships with Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw, Howard Hughes (rumored), Frank Sinatra, and a Spanish bullfighter named Luis Miguel Dominguin. She settled permanently in London in 1968, where she remained until her death in 1990. As per her wishes, her remains were returned to North Carolina for burial with her family at Smithfield’s Sunset Memorial Park.  The Ava Gardner Museum in Smithfield, just a mile from the cemetery, showcases the actress’s fifty-year career

Paul Green,H-114,NCG18538,Q111463957,Q704852,"Among North Carolina’s most revered writers, Paul Eliot Green was born in Harnett County, a region he wrote about and returned to all his life.  He began study at the [University of North Carolina, G-92] in 1916.  Service in World War I interrupted his work but he completed his degree in 1921, soon thereafter marrying Elizabeth Lay.  He pursued graduate study at Cornell but returned to Chapel Hill as a philosophy professor in 1923.  In 1939 he became a professor of dramatic art and associate of his mentor Frederick Koch, a post he held until 1944, resigning then to devote full time to writing.

	Plays were Green’s favored art form but he also wrote short stories, novels, and poetry.  In 1927 he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for the play <i>In Abraham’s Bosom</i>.  He took an early interest in motion pictures and in 1932 entered a contract with Warner Brothers to write scripts.  His signature achievement was development of the outdoor drama (or “symphonic drama,” as he termed it).  Green’s best-known production was <i>The Lost Colony</i> which opened on [Roanoke Island, B-1] in 1937 and runs to this day.  Over time Green wrote sixteen such plays, with productions staged in Florida, [Virginia, J-28], Kentucky, Texas, and elsewhere.  

	Green’s honors were many, including designation by the General Assembly in 1979 as the state’s Dramatist Laureate.  Outside the arts, Green from an early age demonstrated sympathy and compassion for African Americans and the underprivileged.  He was a lifelong champion of human rights and a dedicated opponent of war, lynching, capital punishment, chain gangs, and prejudice.  He long lived off Raleigh Road in Chapel Hill, an area now known as Greenwood.  His last home was “Windy Oaks,” south of Chapel Hill.

Lamar Stringfield,H-94,NCG18617,Q111463937,Q2548443,"Minister O. L. Stringfield in 1892 became pastor at Inwood Baptist Church on Ramcat Road (near present Lake Wheeler Road) outside Raleigh.  Shortly after son Lamar’s birth on October 10, 1897, the family moved to 218 Elm Street nearer downtown.  Lamar was the sixth of seven children.  O. L. Stringfield helped establish [Meredith College, H-38], which opened in 1899 near his new home.

     	Lamar Edwin Stringfield attended college at [Mars Hill, P-34] and [Wake Forest, H-68], but left school in 1916 to join the army, seeing service in Mexico and France.  On his return home, he began serious training in music, both in North Carolina and in New York.  In 1928 Stringfield completed his symphonic suite, “From the Southern Mountains.”  Known thereafter as an authority on southern ballads and folklore, Stringfield organized the Institute of Folk Music at the [University of North Carolina, G-92] in 1930.  His career in many ways paralleled that of [Paul Green, H-114], with whom he collaborated on “The Lost Colony Songbook.”  In 1932 Stringfield helped organize the North Carolina Symphony, then headquartered in Chapel Hill.  He served as the symphony’s first conductor from 1932 to 1938.

       	In his later years, Stringfield moved often, residing in Charlotte, Mars Hill, Burnsville, Barnardsville, and Asheville.  He remained active as a composer and served as guest conductor for major symphony orchestras across the country.  He died in Asheville on January 21, 1959.
